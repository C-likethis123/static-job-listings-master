## My process

### Built with

- React
- Vite
- CSS
- Typescript

### What I learned

This was my first experience with using Vite, so I learnt how to create a project template with Vite from scratch.
Interestingly, Vite allows users to retrieve import URLs using the import.meta module.

### Continued development

While developing this website, I realised a need for CSS Modules to avoid class names in different files from overriding styles.

### Useful resources

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) - This helped me to understand Vite.
